# Oracle Compute
This repository contains the numerai compute example in combination with Oracle Cloud provider. The examples here are meant to be used for inferencing (predictions). The Oracle Compute version is based on the free tier and as such doesn't incur any cost. There are two compute engines available, armx64 (ampere a1) with 24Gb ram and AMD x86/x64 with 1GB ram. The following example will be based on AMD but could also potentially work for the Ampere version (depending on library requirements).

## Disclaimer
No guarantees are given that the example code and instructions here are 100% correct, and make sure to keep check of your cloud costs, it is quite esasy with some little mistakes to increase costs considerably!.As such, if these examples are used, you use them at your own risk! :-)

## Installation steps
For now the installation steps are manual and require knowledge about server maintenance, ssh/sftp and basic linux (ubuntu knowledge). Perform the following steps to create the Ubuntu server and get the server configured for daily/weekly predictions at numerai.
