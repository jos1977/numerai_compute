# Numerai Compute
This repository contains different Numerai Compute cloud examples for the [Numerai Classic Tournament](https://numer.ai). The examples here are meant to be used for inferencing (predictions). At the moment these are examples for different cloud providers (free or paid) however the end-goal will be to provide a platform-agnostic solution which can be maintained with easy one-line commands from python or powershell. Including options for a local compute! (laptop/server/rpi/...).

This repository contains the following projects for now:

- Numerai Azure Compute example, see [here](https://github.com/jos1977/numerai_compute/blob/main/azure/README.md)
- Numerai Oracle Compute example, see [here](https://github.com/jos1977/numerai_compute/blob/main/oracle/README.md)

## Disclaimer
No guarantees are given that the example code and instructions here are 100% correct, and make sure to keep check of your cloud costs, it is quite esasy with some little mistakes to increase costs considerably!.As such, if these examples are used, you use them at your own risk! :-)
